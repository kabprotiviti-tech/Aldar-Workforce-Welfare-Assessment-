# Decisions

## 2026-09-02 — Project skeleton and stack versions

Bootstrapped the repository from empty: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript +
Tailwind + Zod + Vitest, per the stack in the project brief.

- Used Next.js 16.3.4 and postcss 8.5.26 rather than the originally-drafted
  14.2.5/8.4.39 — `npm audit` flagged known CVEs (cache poisoning, DoS,
  XSS/path-traversal in postcss sourcemap handling) against those versions
  with no non-breaking patched release on the 14.x line covering all of
  them. Nothing in the codebase depends on 14.x-specific behavior, so we
  took the current stable major instead. React stays on 18.3.1 (a supported
  peer of Next 16).
- Used Vitest 4.1.11 instead of 1.6.0 for the same reason (esbuild/vite dev-
  server CVE in the 1.x dependency chain). No project code depended on
  Vitest 1.x-only APIs.
- `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities as of this install.

## 2026-09-02 — Deterministic compliance rule engine (`lib/rules/`)

Built the typed rule engine implementing the two things the brief says a
model must never be trusted with: validating that a chosen compliance
status carries the required remark/closure action, and the arithmetic for
the report header metrics. The AI extraction layer, the assessor UI, the
database, and the report renderer are out of scope for this change — this
is the standalone, fully-tested calculation core they will all call into.

**Implemented exactly as specified** (`lib/rules/validation.ts`):
- Question level: `No`/`Unclear`/`Not Applicable` require a remark;
  `No`/`Unclear` additionally require an action required for closure.
- Requirement/area level: `Partial`/`Not Compliant` require an action
  required for closure; `Not Applicable` requires a remark and no closure
  action.
- Validation never assigns or corrects a status — it only reports which
  field is missing, so the item can be routed back to the assessor (rule 7
  in the brief: "cannot be determined" is a routing decision, not a guess
  the engine makes).

**Assumptions made — not fully specified in the brief, flagged for
assessor/client review before they drive a real report** (`lib/rules/aggregate.ts`):
1. **Scoring weights.** `Compliant` = 1, `Partial` = 0.5, `Not Compliant` = 0,
   `Not Applicable` excluded from both numerator and denominator (it isn't a
   compliance measurement). No weighting formula for "Overall Compliance
   (%)" appears in the brief; half-credit for Partial is the common
   convention in this kind of audit scoring but should be confirmed against
   the client's existing report tool before this becomes load-bearing.
2. **"Overall Compliance (%)" vs. "Compliance adjusted for not assessed (%)".**
   Read as: Overall includes carried-forward (not-assessed-this-cycle)
   requirements at their inherited rating; the adjusted figure excludes
   carried-forward requirements from the denominator entirely, showing
   compliance only across what was actually assessed this cycle. This is
   the most literal reading of "adjusted for not assessed" but the brief
   doesn't give a worked example — needs confirming against a real client
   report before shipping.
3. **Risk rating (Low/Medium/High).** Driven only by the 10 key
   requirements, since the brief singles them out: High if any key
   requirement is `Not Compliant`; Medium if a key requirement is `Partial`
   or any non-key requirement is `Not Compliant`; Low otherwise. No
   percentage threshold was introduced on top of this since none is given
   in the brief — adding one would be a second layer of invented business
   logic. Accommodation has no key requirements, so this function only
   applies to Employment Practices / Onboarding.

All three are isolated behind named functions in `aggregate.ts` specifically
so the formulas can be corrected without touching validation or any caller.
